Example to measure Power when PLL is running @max frequency

POWER - PLL MAX

TEST DESCRIPTION:
	This test configures RTC to generate an alarm 18s after
it's started, during which period the system is put into IDLE3 state.
The subsequent RTC alarm interrupt should bring the CPU out of the 
IDLE3 state and resume execution from where it was before it idled out.

When coming out of IDLE3 state, when PLL was shut off, the PLL is 
reconfigured to run at 200MHz and restarted. power can be measured 
while a while(1) is executed at this PLL freqeuncy.

TEST PROCEDURE:
 0. Ensure SW6 [1:2] are {ON,ON}, i.e. away from the DOT.
 1. Ensure JP10 CLKSEL is shorted so that usb osc is not used. 
 2. Run the test. The RTC alarm (expected after approx. 30s) would be set.
 3. Test will stop once usb clk is shut off.
 4. Pause and Resume the test.
 5. The test will execute the idle instsrn that will idle the cpu and wait for the alarm.
 6. Observe if the alarm interrupt got the CPU out of idle state.
 7. Reconfigure PLL frequency to generate 200MHz.
 8. Execute a while(1) with CPU @200MHz.
