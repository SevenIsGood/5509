Example to exhibit IDLE 2 state and recovery using RTC alarm interrupt

POWER - IDLE2 RECOVERY USING RTC ALARM

TEST DESCRIPTION:
	This test configures RTC for generating an alarm 8s after it's 
started, during which period the system is put into IDLE2 state. The 
subsequent RTC alarm interrupt should bring the CPU out of the IDLE2 
state and resume execution from where it was before it idled out.

TEST PROCEDURE AND EXPECTED RESULT: 
 1. Ensure JP10 CLKSEL is shorted so that usb osc is not used. 
 2. Run the test. The RTC alarm (expected after approx. 30s) would be set.
 3. Test will stop once usb clk is shut off.
 4. Pause and Resume the test.
 5. The test will execute the idle instsrn that will idle the cpu and wait for the alarm.
 6. Observe if the alarm interrupt got the CPU out of idle state.
