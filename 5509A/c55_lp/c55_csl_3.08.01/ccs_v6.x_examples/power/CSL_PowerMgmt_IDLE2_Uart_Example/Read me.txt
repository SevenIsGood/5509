section POWER This functionality will test the IDLE/Idle wakeup of the UART module

TEST DESCRIPTION:

	This test configures RTC for generating an alarm 8s after it's 
started, during which period the system is put into IDLE2 state. 
  During the same time, an UART transaction is also
initiated. The expected RTC alarm interrupt should bring the CPU out
of the IDLE2 state and resume execution from where it was before it
  idled out. Also, the UART transaction should have gone through.

TEST PROCEDURE AND EXPECTED RESULT:
   1. Manual test with Pin2/3, Pin7/8 on DB-9 connected, power measured on JP1
 2. Run the test. The RTC alarm (expected after approx. 30s) would be set.
 3. Test will stop once usb clk is shut off.
 4. Pause and Resume the test.
   5. The test will also configure UART and initiate a txfer .
   6. While CPU waits UART transfers, the test will execute the idle instsrn that will idle the cpu and wait for the alarm.
   7. Observe if the alarm interrupt got the CPU out of idle state and the UART transaction goes through.
