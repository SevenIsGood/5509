Example to exhibit I2S DMA TXN IN IDLE 2 state and recovery using RTC alarm interrupt

POWER - I2S DMA TXN IN IDLE2 AND RECOVERY USING RTC ALARM

TEST DESCRIPTION:
	This test configures RTC for generating an alarm 8s after it's 
started, during which period the system is put into IDLE2 state. 
During the same time, an I2S0(Tx)-I2S2(Rx) DMA transaction is also
initiated. The expected RTC alarm interrupt should bring the CPU out
of the IDLE2 state and resume execution from where it was before it
idled out. Also, the I2S DMA transaction should have gone through 
and the rx'ed and tx'ed data shouldn't mismatch.

TEST PROCEDURE AND EXPECTED RESULT:
Manual test with I2S0 connect to I2S2, measuring power on JP1
 1. Ensure JP10 CLKSEL is shorted so that usb osc is not used. 
 2. Run the test. The RTC alarm (expected after approx. 30s) would be set.
 3. Test will stop once usb clk is shut off.
 4. Pause and Resume the test.
 5. The test will also configure I2S0 as Tx and I2S2 as Rx and initiate a txfer using DMA.
 6. While CPU waits for DMA done, the test will execute the idle instsrn that will idle the cpu and wait for the alarm.
 7. Observe if the alarm interrupt got the CPU out of idle state and the I2S transaction goes through.
 8. A comparison of the I2S Read and Write buffers should not throw a mismatch.
