USB EXAMPLE7 - USB CDC TEST</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="USB7x"></a>
TEST DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<p>This test is to verify the operation of the CSL USB and CDC ACM module. This test runs in interrupt mode. USB interrupts are configured and ISR is registered using CSL INTC module. After initializing and configuring the USB module, the test program waits on a while loop. When there is any input from the USB host application USB ISR is triggered and the requested operation is performed inside the ISR.</p>
<p>This USB CDC test can be verified by any terminal program (such as HyperTerminal) which can send or receive data via the virtual COM port for the USB CDC. The attached INF file (C5515_CDC_ACM.inf) is required. The INF file only be installed for the C5515 USB CDC device for the first time, when the using driver wizard of the windriver. This installation is required only when running this example for the first time.</p>
<p>NOTE: IN THE CURRENT CODE EP1 IN IS CONFIGURED FOR COMMUNICATION CLASS INTERFACE EP2 OUT (BULK OUT) AND EP3 (BULK IN) IN ARE CONFIGURED FOR DATA CLASS INTERFACE THOSE CAN BE CHANGED IN CSL_CDC.H</p>
<p>NOTE: THIS TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO WORK WITH CHIP VERSIONS C5535, C5515, AND C5517. MAKE SURE THAT PROPER CHIP VERSION MACRO IS DEFINED IN THE FILE c55xx_csl\inc\csl_general.h.</p>

USB EXAMPLE3 - DMA MODE TEST</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="USB3x"></a>
TEST DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<p>This test is to verify the operation of the CSL USB module.This test runs in DMA mode. USB controller is having DMA module internal to it. This DMA can be used to exchange the data between USB FIFO and the CPU memory. USB interrupt are used to indicate the arrival of request from the host. USB interrupts are configured and ISR is registered using CSL INTC module. After initializing and configuring the USB module test waits on a while loop. When there is any request from the USB host application USB ISR is triggered and the requested operation is performed inside the ISR. Inside the ISR FIFO read and write operations are performed using CPPI DMA module.</p>
<p>This USB test can be verified by a host USB tool which can send/receive data to/from the USB device. This tool should be installed on the host PC for evaluating the CSL USB end point examples. Please contact TI for more details on the USB host tool</p>
<p>NOTE: THIS TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO WORK WITH CHIP VERSIONS C5535, C5515 AND C5517. MAKE SURE THAT PROPER CHIP VERSION MACRO IS DEFINED IN THE FILE c55xx_csl\inc\csl_general.h.</p>

USB EXAMPLE8 - USB HID CLASS TEST</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="USB8x"></a>
TEST DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<p>This test is to verify the operation of the CSL USB HID module. This test initializes the USB HID module, SAR module to read the push button values, the test program then waits in a while loop for the user input through push buttons. The EVM will act as an HID (mouse) device and the PC will act as the Host. Using the push buttons present on the EVM, we can send the mouse commands to the Host PC, from EVM.</p>
<p>This test can be verified by pressing the push buttons on the EVM, and observing whether the corresponding mouse operation is performed on the Host PC.</p>
<pre class="fragment">Digital values corresponding to the button voltage will vary slightly
depending on the system clock value. Below are the range of mouse commands
corresponding to each push button of the EVM

 For C5517 or C5515 EVM:
 UP:   To move the mouse cursor to up from current cursor position
 DN:   To move the mouse cursor to down from current cursor position
 RWD:  To move the mouse cursor to left from current cursor position
 FWD:  To move the mouse cursor to right from current cursor position
 MENU: To send the Right Click command
 MODE: To send the Left Click command
 STOP: To stop the Program

 For C5535 eZDSP:
 SW1:  To move the mouse cursor to left from current cursor position
 SW2:  To move the mouse cursor to right from current cursor position</pre><p>NOTE: THIS TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO WORK WITH CHIP VERSIONS C5515, C5535 AND C5517. MAKE SURE THAT PROPER CHIP VERSION MACRO IS DEFINED IN THE FILE c55xx_csl\inc\csl_general.h.</p>

<p>For verifying the USB operations write few bytes of data to an end point, read same number of bytes from that end point and compare the data read and data written. Data read should be same as data written for a given end point</p>
<p>Data read/write operations for a specific end point are independent of other end points. Data can be written to any end point any number of times with out effecting data buffers of other end points.</p>
<p>Limitations of the test This example and the host test code are implemented to show case how to configure and use the CSL USB module at end point level, but they are not intended to demo full-fledged USB application.</p>
<p>For any endpoint, first operation should be write which can be followed by several read operations. Reading data from an end point without writing data will result in timeout error for USB host tool</p>
<p>Data size read from an end point should always be equal to the size of data written previously to that end point.</p>
<p>Read operation for an end point always returns data written previously to that end point</p>

TEST DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<p>This test is to verify the operation of the CSL USB module. This test runs in poll mode. In the poll mode interrupt registers are read continuously in a while loop. If there is any interrupt observed it will be served and test continues to poll for the next interrupts.</p>
<p>This USB test can be verified by a host USB tool which can send/receive data to/from the USB device. This tool should be installed on the host PC for evaluating the CSL USB end point examples. Please contact TI for more details on the USB host tool</p>

<li>Repeat the test at the following PLL frequencies C5515: 60MHz and 100MHz C5517: 60MHz, 100MHz, 150MHz and 200MHz C5535 eZdsp: 60MHz and 100MHz </li>
<li>Repeat the test in Release mode</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Limitations of the test This example and the host test code are implemented to show case how to configure and use the CSL USB module at end point level, but they are not intended to demo full-fledged USB application.</li>
</ul>
<p>For any endpoint, first operation should be write which can be followed by several read operations. Reading data from an end point without writing data will result in timeout error for USB host tool</p>
<p>Data size read from an end point should always be equal to the size of data written previously to that end point.</p>
<p>Read operation for an end point always returns data written previously to that end point</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="USB1z"></a>
TEST RESULT:</h2>
<ul>
<li>USB device should be detected by the host PC and should be accessible through the USB host application </li>
<li>Data written and data read should match in the host application</li>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="USB10x"></a>
TEST DESCRIPTION:</h2>
<p>This test is to verify the operation of the CSL USB module's WinUSB Generic Device Class (GDC) driver.This test runs in interrupt mode. USB interrupts are configured and ISR is registered using CSL INTC module. After initializing and configuring the USB module test waits on a while loop. When there is any request from the USB host application USB ISR is triggered and the requested operation is performed inside the ISR.</p>
<p>There are 3 endpoints of concern: 1 Control Endpoint 0 1 Bulk IN Endpoint 3 1 Bulk OUT Endpoint 2</p>
<p>A 320x200 bytes image is stored in "image.h" file. When a command is sent from the PC host to the C55 to send an image chunk (command: 0xAA followed by chunk ID - 1 byte for 0xAA, 2 bytes for chunk ID), the same is sent across and when all chunks have been received, the image is displayed on the PC host using the host USB tool.</p>
<p>This USB test is verified by a host USB tool which can send/receive data to/from the USB device. This tool should be installed on the host PC for evaluating the CSL USB end point examples. Please contact TI for more details on the USB host tool</p>
<p>USB enumeration as a Generic Device Class WinUSB device requires a specific inf file - 'ccs_v6.x_examples/usb/CSL_USB_WinUSBExample/C5517_WINUSB.inf' Commands are received on BULK OUT endpoint 2 and Image is sent out via BULK IN endpoint 3.</p>
<p>NOTE: THIS TEST HAS BEEN DEVELOPED TO WORK WITH CHIP VERSION C5515/35/45/17. MAKE SURE THAT PROPER CHIP VERSION MACRO IS DEFINED IN THE FILE c55xx_csl\inc\csl_general.h.</p>

TEST PROCEDURE:</h2>
<ul>
<li>Open the CCS and connect the target (C5515/17 EVMs, C5535 EZDSP or C5545 BoosterPack) </li>
<li>Open, build and load the CSL_USB_WinUSBExample_Out to the target </li>
<li>Set the PLL frequency to 100MHz </li>
<li>Connect the USB device port on target to a Win7 PC (USB Host) </li>
<li>Run the program loaded on to the target </li>
<li>When the new USB device is discovered by the USB host, use C5517_WINUSB.inf to update the new USB device </li>
<li>The newly discovered USB device will be enumerated as C5517_WINUSB </li>
<li>Run the USB host application(WinUsbTest.exe) on the Win7 PC. It displays a dialog window (WINUSB Test Interface) </li>
<li>In the USB Device GUID field, type in 9f543223-cede-4fa3-b376-a25ce9a30e74 and click 'Find' tab. </li>
<li>Once the device is detected, 'Attached' is displayed below the 'Find' tab. Until then, it displays 'Detached'. </li>
<li>Once the C55xx EVM is 'Attached', Click 'Image Test' tab. </li>
<li>A vertical bar on a white background is displayed under 'Received Image'. </li>
<li>The bar sweeps from the left edge to the right edge and then starts sweeping all over from left edge to the right again. It goes on continuously. </li>
<li>Clicking the 'Image Test' tab again stops the moving bar. </li>
<li>Click the 'Image Test' tab once more and the vertical bar resumes the sweep from where it last stopped. </li>
<li>The vertical bar also changes colour randomly.</li>
</ul>
