This file describes  modifications between trunk and C55.

1. confidence.h
CM_MAX_WORD set from MAX_WORD_UTT to 10. - Should change MAX_WORD_UTT.

2. confidence_user.h 
CM_hypo and ConfType types moved to gmhmm_type.h. The 
user does not need to know the details of these structures?

3. dist.c 
Added casts for operations.

4. dist_user.h
Added casts for operations.

5. engine_sireco_init.c
Added  tiesr->SADState to expose state.

6. gmhmm.h

Reduced sizes of MAX_STR, MAX_WORD, MAX_FRM_NBR. Add pointer cast.

7. gmhmm_si_api.h 
Added aDoSearch in declaration of CallSearchEngine. Needs to be fixed in trunk

8. gmhmm_type.h

Moved CM_hypo and ConfType types from confidence_user.h.
CM_SIZE set to 1000
Added buf_idx to gmhmm_type so that tiesr can run continuously even when
signal_cnt limits.
Implemented Boolean type so C++ not assumed
Changed from short pointer to type pointers in gmhmm_type for type checking-
MODEL_PRUNE_type,NssType,ConfType

9. gmhmm_type_common.c 
Cast NULL

10. hlr_status.h
fix enum comma at end

11. jac-estm.c
Copyrights for 2011
Added my_fileio.h control
cast NULL as needed
changed to my_* for files as needed

12. jac-estm.h
Removed duplicate GET_NORM def.

13. jac_one.c
Removed Safety check in wsva_var_scale. Why? 
Changed computation in sva_weightedSVA. Why?
This was not removed for C55, but rather added in trunk. It should be merged
into C55 branch. See comments on bug #1326. This also affects sbc.

14. jac_one.h
Changed NOISEWAIT to 5

Removed MAX_DIM_WSVA_STATIC and MAX_DIM_WSVA_DELTA. Why? How is the
polynomial wsva_polycoef handled? 

Same as (13 above - added in trunk, and should be merged into C55 branch.

15. liveproc.c
Many changes so that JAC can run continuously prior to speech detection. Should
be merged into trunk.

16. load.c
Made changes for different file name separators, and using my_*. Should not be
merged back to trunk.
Added some casts.

17. load_user.h
Declarations of load_word list and load_mu. I don't think these are necessary
for non-C55 for now.

18. mfcc_f.c
Added code in several places of trunk to handle all zero inputs - rev 74 #1350
This should be merged into C55 branch.

19. noise_sub.c
Some cast additions
Modified calls to use my_* io functions
Removed mem_alloc control from trunk to use plain malloc.

These changes not needed in trunk at this time.

20.noise_sub.h
Remove declaration of memory to manage. Changes not needed in trunk.

21. pmc_f.c
Added casts for C55

22. rapidsearch.c
Added casts and changes for calls to my_* io.
Removed using of mem_alloc control. Do not change trunk.
Trunk has parameters for vad moved to rapidsearch.h where they should be.
Perhaps this should be included in C55 branch.

23. rapidsearch.h
Trunk has constants and structures in rapidsearch.h rather than rapidsearch.c,
so no need to change trunk.

24. sbc.c
Trunk has code to allow MFCC priors of any dimension (rev 57 #1326). Should be
merged into C55 branch.
Mods to use my_* file io
Removal of mem_alloc and replace with malloc. Do not merge into trunk.

25. sbc.h
Trunk has parameters for limited sbc priors. Should be merged into C55 branch.

26. sbc_struct_user.h
C55 removes the base memory that sbc manages. Do not merge to trunk.

27. search.c
Casts added.
Move local variables zt th_n
Adds #ifdefs for pruning so code not added if not enabled - constant array powt
only if pruning enabled. Reset only if real time guard. Should be included in
trunk.
Set symcode and frm to -1 in C55. should not merge to trunk.

28. search_user.h
In C55 change BEAM_CELL_LIMIT, introduce TOTAL_BSS. Not needed in trunk.

29. siinit.c

Change allocation of data going into gv, modify for my_* io, and add casts. Do
not merge these to trunk.

30. siproc.c
Modify for my_* and add casts. Do not merge these to trunk.

31. status.h
C55 moved definition of utterance detector state to status.h. Merge to trunk,
since now the state is exposed to user.

32. tiesr_config.h
Changes for C55 selections. Trunk does not need to change.

33. tiesr_engine_api_sireco.h
C55 puts additional argument on CallSearchEngine for specifying to run
recognition. Also adds the SADState function to obtain the state of SAD. Should
be merged to trunk.

34. tiesrcommonmacros.h
Minor ifdefs for C55. Do not merge with trunk.

35. uttdet.c
Added SADState function and corrected tmp_l declaration. Merge to trunk.

36. uttdet.h
Added casts. Do not merge with trunk.

37. uttdet_user.h
Added SADState function. Merge to trunk.

38. winlen.h
Added C55 specific handling parameters. Do not merge with trunk.
