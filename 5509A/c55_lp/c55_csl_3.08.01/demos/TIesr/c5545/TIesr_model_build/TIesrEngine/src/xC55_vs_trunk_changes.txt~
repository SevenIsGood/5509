This file describes modifications between trunk and C55.

1. confidence.h
CM_MAX_WORD set from MAX_WORD_UTT to 10 in C55. Rather than set CM_MAX_WORD to
a given value, one should change MAX_WORD_UTT in gmhmm.h, as done in trunk. 

*C55 branch changed back to agree with trunk, but set MAX_WORD_UTT to 10.
3/15/12

Confidence parameters are declared as extern const for C55 and const for trunk
version.

*Changed trunk code to include extern. 3/16/12

2. confidence_user.h 
In C55 the declarations of the CM_hypo and ConfType types were moved to
gmhmm_type.h, since the gmhmm type has a pointer to each of these, and it is
right to cast the pointers properly rather than to say they are short pointers,
as is done in the trunk. However, moving the declarations to gmhmm_type.h breaks
the modularity of the code. It would be best to keep the declarations in
confidence_user.h as in the trunk, then in both C55 and trunk include that
header in gmhmm_type.h and change the pointers in the gmhmm type structure
accordingly.

*Reverted C55 branch gmhmm_type.h change to remove the type declarations. This
required a large change in both trunk and C55 branch. Introduced new files
confidence_struct_user.h and rapidsearch_struct_user.h in order to expose the
structures to gmhmm_type.h. Changed gmhmm_type.h to use MODEL_PRUNE_type,
NssType, and ConfType. In trunk gmhmm_type.h changed type of need_compact from
bool to Boolean, in order to maintain C only.  In C55 gmhmm_type.h removed the
#ifdef __cplusplus and bool, changing it to Boolean. Added MFCC buf_idx in trunk
gmhmm_type.h as part of implementing continuous running. 3/16/12

3. dist.c 
Added casts for operations.

*Added casts for most operations to the code in trunk. For a few of the
operations I did not add casts. These were of the form  

outlongval = alongval >> shortval;

I think these should be ok since the shortval will be converted to long. 4/11/12

4. dist_user.h
Added casts for operations.

*Merged changes into trunk to add casts. 4/11/12

5. engine_sireco_init.c
Added  tiesr->SADState to expose state.

*Merged changes into trunk to remove #ifdef's and expose state. 4/11/12

6. gmhmm.h

Reduced sizes of MAX_STR, MAX_WORD, MAX_FRM_NBR. Add pointer cast.

* Added a pointer cast in the macro SET_NEXT_SYM. During rebuild noted that
SET_NEXT_SYM and SET_SYM_CELL are defined in both gmhmm.h and search.c(pp).
Deleted the definitions in search.c(pp) for both trunk and C55 branch, since
these should be in only one place. 4/13/12

7. gmhmm_si_api.h 
Added aDoSearch in declaration of CallSearchEngine. Needs to be fixed in trunk.

*Merged changes into trunk. 4/11/12

8. gmhmm_type.h

Moved CM_hypo and ConfType types from confidence_user.h. This should not be
done. Rather, include confidence_user.h in gmhmm_type.h.
CM_SIZE set to 1000
Added buf_idx to gmhmm_type so that tiesr can run continuously even when
signal_cnt limits.
Implemented Boolean type so C++ not assumed
Changed from short pointer to type pointers in gmhmm_type for type checking-
MODEL_PRUNE_type,NssType,ConfType

* Made changes to expose CM_hypo and ConfType types in specific headers. Added
buf_idx, implemented Boolean type and changed pointers in trunk. 4/12/12

9. gmhmm_type_common.c 
Cast NULL

*Merged changes into trunk. 4/13/12

10. hlr_status.h
fix enum comma at end

*Merged to trunk. 4/13/12

11. jac-estm.c
Copyrights for 2011
Added my_fileio.h control
cast NULL as needed
changed to my_* for files as needed

*Only included the casts from NULL in trunk. The my_* is specific to C55.
4/16/12

12. jac-estm.h
Removed duplicate GET_NORM def.

*Merged into trunk. 4/11/12

13. jac_one.c
Removed Safety check in wsva_var_scale. Why? 
Changed computation in sva_weightedSVA. Why?
This was not removed for C55, but rather added in trunk. It should be merged
into C55 branch. See comments on bug #1326. This also affects sbc.

* Changed jac_one.c in C55 branch to include the change in trunk so that
any mfcc vector size is now handled for wsva. But normally wsva is not used
for C55. 4/16/12

14. jac_one.h
Changed NOISEWAIT to 5

Removed MAX_DIM_WSVA_STATIC and MAX_DIM_WSVA_DELTA. Why? How is the
polynomial wsva_polycoef handled? 

Same as (13 above - added in trunk, and should be merged into C55 branch.

*Changed jac_one.h in C55 branch to include change in trunk so that any mfcc
vector size is now handled for wsva.  But normally wsva is not used
for C55. 4/16/12

15. liveproc.c
Many changes so that JAC can run continuously prior to speech detection. Should
be merged into trunk.

* Merged into trunk. Commented out the line that returns a timeout if signal_cnt
is greater than threshold. Removed variable noise_start_time and the commented
sections of code that calculated it in both C55 and trunk. Now TIesr should
now be able to do adaptation and utterance detection continuously. 4/11/12

16. load.c
Made changes for different file name separators, and using my_*. Should not be
merged back to trunk.
Added some casts.

*Added casts to trunk load.cpp. Made one change for missing cast in load.c.
4/17/12


17. load_user.h
Declarations of load_word list and load_mu. I don't think these are necessary
for non-C55 for now.

* No action taken. Trunk left as is. 4/17/12

18. mfcc_f.c
Added code in several places of trunk to handle all zero inputs - rev 74 #1350
This should be merged into C55 branch.

*Added cast changes from C55 branch to trunk. Added changes to handle zero 
inputs from trunk to C55 branch. 4/18/12

18a. mfcc_f.h
Definition of PI is in mfcc_f.h in C55 branch. Should be moved to mfcc_f.c as
in trunk, since PI is float not needed except to generate data which is
included only for documentation purposes.

*Changed in C55 branch. 4/18/12

19. noise_sub.c
Some cast additions
Modified calls to use my_* io functions
Removed mem_alloc control from trunk to use plain malloc.

These changes not needed in trunk at this time.

*Added one cast in trunk. 4/18/12

20.noise_sub.h
Remove declaration of memory to manage. Changes not needed in trunk.

21. pmc_f.c
Added casts for C55

*Merged casts to trunk. 4/18/2012

22. rapidsearch.c
Added casts and changes for calls to my_* io.
Removed using of mem_alloc control. Do not change trunk.
Trunk has parameters for vad moved to rapidsearch.h where they should be.
Perhaps this should be included in C55 branch.

Added casts.   4/20/12 


23. rapidsearch.h
Trunk has constants and structures in rapidsearch.h rather than rapidsearch.c,
so no need to change trunk.

rapidsearch.h in trunk and C55 branch were changed to be identical
some time before 4/20/12

24. sbc.c
Trunk has code to allow MFCC priors of any dimension (rev 57 #1326). Should be
merged into C55 branch.

* Made changes in C55 branch. 4/25/12

Mods to use my_* file io
Removal of mem_alloc and replace with malloc. Do not merge into trunk.



25. sbc.h
Trunk has parameters for limited sbc priors. Should be merged into C55 branch.

* Made changes in C55 branch. 4/25/12

26. sbc_struct_user.h
C55 removes the base memory that sbc manages. Do not merge to trunk.

27. search.c
Casts added.
Move local variables zt th_n
Adds #ifdefs for pruning so code not added if not enabled - constant array powt
only if pruning enabled. Reset only if real time guard. Should be included in
trunk.

*  Made changes in trunk 4/26/12

Set symcode and frm to -1 in C55. should not merge to trunk.

28. search_user.h
In C55 change BEAM_CELL_LIMIT, introduce TOTAL_BSS. Not needed in trunk.

Change allocation of data going into gv, modify for my_* io, and add casts. Do
not merge these to trunk.

*Added casts in trunk. 5/4/12

30. siproc.c
Modify for my_* and add casts. Do not merge these to trunk.

* Added the cast to trunk. 4/26/12

31. status.h
C55 moved definition of utterance detector state to status.h. Merge to trunk,
since now the state is exposed to user.

*Merged changes into trunk. After some thought, decided that the detector state
should not be in status.h so moved it into uttdet_user.h. Modified both the
trunk and C55 branches. 4/11/12

32. tiesr_config.h
Changes for C55 selections. Trunk does not need to change.

33. tiesr_engine_api_sireco.h
C55 puts additional argument on CallSearchEngine for specifying to run
recognition. Also adds the SADState function to obtain the state of SAD. Should
be merged to trunk.

*Merged changes into trunk. 4/11/12

34. tiesrcommonmacros.h
