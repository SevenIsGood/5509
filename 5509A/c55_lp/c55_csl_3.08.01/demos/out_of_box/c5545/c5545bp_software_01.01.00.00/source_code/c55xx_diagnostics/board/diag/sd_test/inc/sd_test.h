 * CPU frequency. This value is used as clock divider value for
 * calling the API MMC_sendOpCond(). Value of the clock rate computed
 * by this function will change depending on the system clock value
 * and SD card maximum clock value defined by macro 'CSL_SD_CLOCK_MAX_KHZ'.
 * Minimum clock rate value returned by this function is 0 and
 * maximum clock rate value returned by this function is 255.
 * Clock derived using the clock rate returned by this API will be
 * the nearest value to 'CSL_SD_CLOCK_MAX_KHZ'.
